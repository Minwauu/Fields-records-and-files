## Files

A file is a data structure for storing data. The number of items of data stored in the file can vary in time and the amount of data is not limited in the way that other data structures are because files rely on **secondary storage** such as magnetic disk for their storage unlike arrays which rely on RAM storage.

By using secondary stoarage, files **persist in time** because secondary storage is non-volatile whereas RAM is volatile.

Files have types, such as **text**

## Text files

Text files are files whose contents are sequences of characters organised on a line by line basis. May be opened and read in a text editor such as Microsoft's WordPad.
